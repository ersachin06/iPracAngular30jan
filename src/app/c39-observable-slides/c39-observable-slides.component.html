<!-- 
When does the observable start emitting - this timing matters.
Hot Obserable : start emitting items as soon as it is created , so any observer who later subscribes to that 
observable may start observing the sequence some where in middle.
ex- youtube live - 

Cold Observable : Wait untill the observer subscribe to it before it begin to emit items, and so a observer is
gauranteed to see the whole sequence from the begining.
ex- uploaded video
untill the subscriber subscribe - cold observer does not begin to emit items.
